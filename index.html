 <p>
    My main interests are <strong>youth leadership projects, networking opportunities, and global experiences.</strong>
 </p>

<p>
    Ever-growing human, looking forward to expanding my knowledge and comprehension of people and the world.

<h2>Why It Girls?</h2>
<p>
    What grabbed my attention to IT Girls was the possibility to learn more about technology, such an important topic nowadays, while meeting many incredible women and having lots of fun! I hope to deepen my understanding of information and how we can use technology to share insightful ideas and promote positive social impact. 
</p>

<h2>Personal Information</h2>
<p>
    In my free time, I really enjoy watching dystopian movies and series (I'm a huge fan of The Walking Dead and The 100), playing with my dog, taking pictures, participating in projects, or reading literally any kind of book (although I especially like crime fiction).
