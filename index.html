        <h1>Sofia Oliveira's Biography</h1>
 <p>
    I'm Sofia, a Brazilian senior high-schooler passionate about Science, Education, and Politics.
 </p>     
 <p>
    I am interested in youth leadership projects, networking opportunities, and global experiences.
 </p>  
<p>
    If I had to describe myself in three words, I would choose <strong>resilient, determined, and ambitious.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Ever-growing human, looking forward to expanding my knowledge and comprehension of people and the world.
</p>
<p>
    What grabbed my attention to It Girls was the possibility to learn more about technology, such an important topic nowadays, while meeting many incredible people and having lots of fun! I hope to deepen my understanding of information and how we can use technology to share insightful ideas and promote positive social impact.

<h2>Personal Information</h2>
<p>
    In my free time, I really enjoy watching dystopian movies and series (I'm a huge fan of The Walking Dead and The 100), playing with my dog, taking pictures, participating in projects, or reading literally any kind of book (although I especially like crime fiction).
