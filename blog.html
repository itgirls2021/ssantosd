    <h2>Cryptography Insights</h2>
    
    <p>Sofia Oliveira / July 20th, 2021</p>
    <p>
        Cryptography is essential to secret and secure communication across the globe. It is as old as basic human communication, and thus it has evolved a lot throughout the years. Encrypted messages can be used in war communications, business projects, daily contacts with people anywhere in the world, and much more. 
        <p>
        Although women have been contributing to this field for a long time, beginning with Elizabeth Friedman in the World War II, our ideas and accomplishments have been belittled and ignored. Nowadays, we have better opportunities to grow in this area and help make international information more secure. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Elizabeth Friedman was another victim of a social system that undermines women’s contributions in the most diverse fields, but especially those within STEM. Besides not being recognized for her essential work to the betterment of modern cryptology, her pioneer spirit in a male-dominated area was completely ignored and left out of history. She had her achievement stolen by a man and could not grow in her career anymore – yet, after decades of her death, her life experiences and work are finally being globally recognized and appreciated by everyone. She cleaned the path and bore with sexism and disrespect so that we could proudly be women in technology today.

    <p>Sofia Oliveira / July 27th, 2021</p>
    <p>
        The video below is a tutorial on how to size and resize images. It was very clear and easy to understand, and it even helped to resize the banner I previously created for my website! :)

    <h2>Game Challenge</h2>

    <p>Sofia Oliveira / August 2nd, 2021</p>
<p>
    Last Friday (08/02/2021), we had an amazing class on the topic of Women in Video Games Design. Firstly, we went through a historical view of women in this field, discussing their contributions and future perspectives. 
    Then, we moved to a hands-on activity: idealizing our own game! I was in Team C, so we had to create a game for the exhibit "One Climate, One Planet", helping visitors understand how their individual actions impact others and the environment. 
    Our company was called "Women's Global Climate Corporation" and the game's title was "ONECRW".
</p>

<p>
    It is a multiplayer, open-world, decision making game, with possibilities to play through different servers and even create your own character. 
</p>

<p>
    Players have to choose an area in the map - each area dealt with different climate effects and were inspired in the different world continents. 
    After that, they have to build their house, either adopting sustainable practices or just being ignorant and contribuing to a bad environment.
    Every single individual action would reverberate throughout the whole area, impacting directly other players negatively or positively, depending on his or her decisions. 
</p>

<p>
    It is possible to accumulate points by performing eco-friendly actions or lose it if you spread negative climate effects.
    Players must work together to promote the betterment of their area and go up in the global ranking. This promotes both collaboration among the community within each area and competition involving all global players. 
</p>

<p>
    I would definitely play this game if it existed, and I was happy that we came up with such a good idea in such a limited time. :)
