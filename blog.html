    Cryptography is essential to secret and secure communication across the globe. It is as old as basic human communication, and thus it has evolved a lot throughout the years. Encrypted messages can be used in war communications, business projects, daily contacts with people anywhere in the world, and much more. 
    <p>
    Although women have been contributing to this field for a long time, beginning with Elizabeth Friedman in the World War II, our ideas and accomplishments have been belittled and ignored. Nowadays, we have better opportunities to grow in this area and help make international information more secure.

    Elizabeth Friedman was another victim of a social system that undermines women’s contributions in the most diverse fields, but especially those within STEM. Besides not being recognized for her essential work to the betterment of modern cryptology, her pioneer spirit in a male-dominated area was completely ignored and left out of history. She had her achievement stolen by a man and could not grow in her career anymore – yet, after decades of her death, her life experiences and work are finally being globally recognized and appreciated by everyone. She cleaned the path and bore with sexism and disrespect so that we could proudly be women in technology today.
